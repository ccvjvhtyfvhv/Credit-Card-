# Credit-Card-
The project is about credit card fraud detection using machine learning algorithms. Projects involves credit card fraud detection using machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions, machine learning algorithms are used to identify the fraudulent transactions like random forest decision tree, logistic regression. and also used encoding and scaling techniques to transform the categorical values. I used a real-world dataset that contains transaction records, transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical values. The goal was to classify transactions as either genuine or fraudulent. I performed data preprocessing, handled class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, and experimented with algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The model was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project helped me understand real-world challenges in fraud detection and how machine learning can be applied to improve financial security.
